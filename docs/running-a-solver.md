## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** ≥ 20 (for the solver, SDK, and mempool client)
- **A Stellar account** with sufficient XLM for transaction fees and locking liquidity on Stellar
- **An EVM account** (private key) with sufficient balance on the source chain (e.g., Base, Ethereum) to participate in the escrow
- **RPC endpoints**:
  - Soroban RPC URL (e.g., `https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org`)
  - EVM RPC URL (e.g., Base, Arbitrum; any chain the escrow is deployed on)
- **Perihelion mempool** URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8080` for local testnet, or a remote instance)
- **Deployed contracts**:
  - EVM escrow contract address and ABI (Solidity-based)
  - Soroban settlement contract ID (on Stellar)

## Environment Setup

### 1. Clone the repository and install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Perihelion-Protocol/Perihelion.git
cd perihelion

npm install
npm run build
```

### 2. Generate or import accounts

**Stellar account (keypair for fill_intent signature):**
Generate a new keypair or use an existing one:
```bash
# Generate new keypair (save the secret key securely)
npm --prefix sdk exec -- soroban keys generate solver

# Or import an existing key
export PERIHELION_SOROBAN_SECRET_KEY=S...
```

**EVM account (private key for source chain lock signature):**
Export your EVM private key as a hex string:
```bash
# For testnet, use your MetaMask or wallet seed phrase derivation
# Store securely in environment or secrets manager
export PERIHELION_EVM_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
```

### 3. Fund accounts

**Stellar account:**
- Obtain testnet XLM with `stellar keys fund` ([Stellar CLI](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/tools/cli)) or a faucet
- On mainnet, acquire XLM through an exchange

**EVM account:**
- Bridge or acquire the source chain asset (USDC, ETH, etc.)
- Obtain testnet gas (e.g., Base Sepolia ETH from a faucet)

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the `solver/` directory by copying and editing `.env.example`:

```bash
cp solver/.env.example solver/.env
# Edit solver/.env with your values
```

### Key Configuration Parameters

| Parameter | Example | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| `PERIHELION_MEMPOOL_URL` | `http://localhost:8080` | Mempool API endpoint (local or remote) |
| `PERIHELION_SOLVER_MODE` | `live` | `live` (default) or `watch`. In `watch` mode the solver evaluates intents and logs decisions but never invokes the executor, so no executor variables are required. See [Watch-only mode](#watch-only-mode). |
| `PERIHELION_SOLVER_ADDRESS` | `0x1234...` | Your EVM address (for preferredSolver reserves). In `live` mode this is **optional**: if set, it must match the address derived from `PERIHELION_EVM_PRIVATE_KEY` or the solver refuses to start. In `watch` mode it is the only way to declare an identity. |
| `PERIHELION_MIN_MARGIN_BPS` | `15` | Minimum profit margin in basis points (15 bps = 0.15%) |
| `PERIHELION_SOURCE_NATIVE_FEE_FLOOR` | `3000000000000000` | Minimum source-chain native balance, in **wei**, the solver must hold to accept a fill (gas for `lock` + its LayerZero fee). `0` (default) disables the check unless a live estimator is wired. See [Native balance](#native-balance). |
| `PERIHELION_STELLAR_NATIVE_FEE_FLOOR` | `20000000` | Minimum XLM balance, in **stroops**, the solver must hold to accept a fill (`deliver_intent` + `dispatch_confirmation`, incl. `lz_fee`). `0` (default) disables the check. |
| `PERIHELION_POLL_INTERVAL_MS` | `2000` | Mempool poll interval in milliseconds |
| `PERIHELION_SUPPORTED_ASSETS` | `native,USDC:GA5Z...` | Comma-separated assets you provide liquidity for |
| `PERIHELION_EVM_RPC_URL` | `https://base-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/...` | EVM chain RPC endpoint |
| `PERIHELION_SOROBAN_RPC_URL` | `https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org` | Soroban RPC endpoint |
| `PERIHELION_EVM_PRIVATE_KEY` | `0x...` | EVM private key (keep secure) |
| `PERIHELION_SOROBAN_SECRET_KEY` | `S...` | Stellar secret key (keep secure) |
| `PERIHELION_ESCROW_ADDRESS` | `0x5678...` | Deployed escrow contract address |
| `PERIHELION_SETTLEMENT_CONTRACT_ID` | `ABC123...` | Soroban settlement contract ID |
| `PERIHELION_SOURCE_CHAIN_ID` | `8453` | LayerZero EID of the source chain |
| `STELLAR_NETWORK` | `testnet` | Stellar network the solver targets (`testnet` or `mainnet`). **Required** — the solver refuses to start without it. Must be set alongside the other executor variables (`PERIHELION_EVM_RPC_URL`, `PERIHELION_SOROBAN_RPC_URL`, keys, contract addresses) and must match the network your Soroban RPC endpoint and settlement contract are deployed on. |
| `PERIHELION_METRICS_PORT` | `9090` | Port for the `/metrics` Prometheus endpoint |
| `PERIHELION_METRICS_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Bind address for `/metrics` — see [Network exposure](#network-exposure) before widening |
| `PERIHELION_METRICS_TOKEN` | — | If set, `/metrics` requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>` |

### Executor configuration is mandatory in live mode

The solver will not start in `live` mode unless the full executor configuration
is present: `PERIHELION_EVM_RPC_URL`, `PERIHELION_SOROBAN_RPC_URL`,
`PERIHELION_EVM_PRIVATE_KEY`, `PERIHELION_SOROBAN_SECRET_KEY`,
`PERIHELION_ESCROW_ADDRESS`, `PERIHELION_SETTLEMENT_CONTRACT_ID`,
`PERIHELION_SOURCE_CHAIN_ID` and `STELLAR_NETWORK`. If any is missing the CLI
exits with a configuration error naming the missing variables rather than
starting an executor that cannot sign anything. There is no silent fallback to
an empty executor.

### Watch-only mode

Set `PERIHELION_SOLVER_MODE=watch` to run the solver as a dry run. In this mode
the solver polls the mempool, evaluates every intent (pricing, margin, inventory
and native-balance checks) and logs the resulting decision, but it never
constructs or calls an executor, so no fills are attempted and no capital is
committed. Executor variables are not required; `PERIHELION_SOLVER_ADDRESS` is
used only to decide which reserved intents would be eligible for you.

Watch mode is the right way to validate pricing, fee estimators and inventory
readers against a live mempool before funding keys. The startup log states
explicitly that the solver is running in watch-only mode.

### Solver address must match the signing key

In `live` mode the solver's EVM identity is derived from
`PERIHELION_EVM_PRIVATE_KEY` (`privateKeyToAccount(...)`). The escrow enforces
`preferredSolver == msg.sender`, so if `PERIHELION_SOLVER_ADDRESS` disagreed with
the key, the solver would accept intents reserved for one address and pay gas
for `lock` transactions that revert with `ReservedForSolver` (or skip intents
reserved for its real address). To prevent this, at startup the solver derives
the address from the private key and **refuses to start** if
`PERIHELION_SOLVER_ADDRESS` is set and differs from it. The error message prints
both addresses. Either unset `PERIHELION_SOLVER_ADDRESS` (recommended — the
derived address is used) or correct it to the derived value.

### Split-fill dispatch deadline

After `deliver_intent` marks an intent filled, the solver must dispatch
`FillConfirmed` no later than `deadline + 30 minutes`. The Soroban settlement
contract rejects later dispatches because the EVM escrow permits its local
refund fallback from the protocol's minimum `confirmationGrace` boundary.
Treat this as a hard monitoring deadline: a late dispatch is futile and must not
be retried as if it could still release the escrow.

### Customization Points

For production use, you likely need to customize:

1. **`quote.ts:priceDestAsset()`** — Replace the stub 1:1 pricing with real routing logic:
   - Query SDEX for XLM/asset trading pairs
   - Integrate external DEX pricing (e.g., CoinGecko, Uniswap, 1inch)
   - Account for your own inventory levels and risk

2. **`quote.ts:defaultFeeEstimator()`** — This defaults to `0n` (no fees). Supply a
   real `feeEstimator` (source-chain gas + LayerZero + Stellar resource fee, in
   dest-asset units) via `EvaluateDeps` before running against real capital, or
   every intent will be priced as if settlement were free. `PERIHELION_MIN_MARGIN_BPS`
   is enforced against the fee-inclusive margin, so an accurate fee estimate is
   required for that gate to mean anything.

3. **`quote.ts:defaultDecimalsLookup()`** — This throws for any EVM token
   address it doesn't recognize (it will never guess a token's decimals, since
   guessing wrong misprices by orders of magnitude). Supply a `DecimalsLookup`
   covering every EVM asset you support, e.g. an on-chain `erc20.decimals()`
   reader, before running against real capital. See [docs/assets.md](../docs/assets.md).

4. **Executor configuration** — Wire real settlement legs:
   - Ensure your EVM account can sign transactions on the source chain
   - Verify Stellar keypair has funds for transaction fees
   - Test the integration against a testnet first (see [Deployment & Operations](./deployment.md))

### Inventory Model

Each poll tick, the solver checks a destination asset's `availableBalance()` before
committing to a fill. That balance read hits chain state directly, so it does not
reflect a fill the solver *just* submitted until the transaction confirms — a real
gap of several seconds. Without additional bookkeeping, a second intent for the
same asset could be evaluated against the same stale balance and over-commit it.

To close that gap, `Solver` holds an in-memory `InFlightTracker`
(`solver/src/inventory.ts`) that is passed into `evaluate()` alongside your
`InventoryProvider`. Before calling `executor.fill()`, the solver reserves the
intent's `minDestAmount` against that asset; `evaluate()` subtracts current
reservations from the balance it reads, so a second intent competing for the
same capacity is skipped as "insufficient inventory" instead of over-filling.
The reservation is released in a `finally` block once the fill settles — whether
it succeeds or fails — so a failed fill immediately frees its capacity for retry
or for another intent.

Failures are classified by whether capital could have moved. *Definite*
failures — a failed `fill_intent` simulation, `sendTransaction` returning
`ERROR`, a transaction result with status `FAILED`, or a `writeContract` revert
before broadcast — are wrapped in `DefiniteFailureError`, and the reservation is
released in the same tick. *Indefinite* failures — timeouts and unknown errors,
where the transaction may still land — keep the reservation until the next
refresh, so the solver never over-commits against a fill that might confirm.

This tracker is in-memory only and resets on restart, so it protects a single
solver process's polling loop; it is not a substitute for your `InventoryProvider`
reporting real, current balances.

### Native balance

A fill spends **three** balances, and the destination-asset check above only
covers one of them:

1. **Destination asset on Stellar** — checked via `availableBalance()`.
2. **Source-chain native token** — `PerihelionEscrow.lock` is `payable` and
   reverts with `FeeTooLow` unless `msg.value` covers the LayerZero quote, on
   top of the gas for a call that pulls the user's tokens and dispatches the
   cross-chain message.
3. **XLM on Stellar** — `deliver_intent` and `dispatch_confirmation` each need a
   funded source account, and `dispatch_confirmation` takes an `lz_fee` the
   caller supplies. Use `quote_fill_confirmed_fee(dst_eid)` to quote this accurately; passing an empty payload to `quote_lz_fee` returns a lower bound that will revert.

Running out of either native balance *after* a fill is committed is far worse
than skipping it: the worst ordering is running out of XLM once the EVM `lock`
has already succeeded — the user's funds are locked, the `FillInstruction` is
dispatched, and the destination leg cannot complete until `cancelExpired`.

To guard against this, extend your `InventoryProvider` with the optional
`nativeBalanceSource()` (wei) and `nativeBalanceDest()` (stroops) readers.
`evaluate()` compares each against an estimated per-fill cost and, on a
shortfall, declines with a non-terminal skip whose `FillDecision.nativeShortfall`
flag is set — the solver logs this at **error** level and records a distinct
skip reason, because it is an operator-actionable funding condition that blocks
*every* intent rather than a property of one. Supply the estimate either as:

- a live estimator via `EvaluateDeps` — `escrowSourceNativeCost(escrowClient,
  lockGasBufferWei)` in `quote.ts` wraps `PerihelionEscrowClient.quoteFee` for
  the source leg — or
- a static floor: `PERIHELION_SOURCE_NATIVE_FEE_FLOOR` /
  `PERIHELION_STELLAR_NATIVE_FEE_FLOOR` (both default `0`, which leaves the
  corresponding check disabled).

If your `InventoryProvider` does not implement the native readers, the check is
skipped and behaviour is unchanged.

## Starting the Solver

```bash
cd solver
npm run dev
```

```

## Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Intent poll frequency** — Normally every 2 seconds (or your `POLL_INTERVAL_MS`)
   - If this slows down, check mempool connectivity and RPC latency

2. **Fill success rate** — Track fills vs. considers:
   - High rejection rate → repricing logic issue, or insufficient margin
   - Low fill rate → margins too aggressive, or competing solvers faster

3. **Balance monitoring** — Watch fee drain and liquidity:
   - Monitor your Stellar asset holdings for depletion
   - Monitor EVM chain gas costs and escrow balance
   - Monitor the **native** balances a fill spends — source-chain gas token and
     XLM — separately from destination-asset inventory
   - Alert if balance drops below a threshold
   - Alert on the `nativeShortfall` skip (logged at error level): the solver is
     declining every intent because it cannot fund a fill leg

4. **Latency** — Time from intent registration to fill:
   - Measure end-to-end settlement time (ideally < 30 seconds for single corridor)
   - Monitor RPC response times to both chains

### Logs to watch

The solver logs to `stdout`. Look for:

```
[2026-06-25T16:35:00Z] Evaluating intent hash=0x123... margin=50 bps [PROFITABLE]
[2026-06-25T16:35:01Z] Filled intent hash=0x123... amount=1000000
[2026-06-25T16:35:02Z] Confirmed on source chain, solver repaid
[2026-06-25T16:35:03Z] ERROR: InsufficientLiquidity for USDC
```

### External monitoring

Set up alerts for:
- **Process crash** — solver exits unexpectedly
- **Connection loss** — mempool unreachable, RPC timeout
- **Fill failure** — transaction reverts on either chain
- **Low balance** — Stellar or EVM account balance below threshold

### Network exposure

`/metrics` (`solver/src/cli.ts`) publishes `SolverMetrics`: fill attempts,
wins, losses, and realised profit in basis points. On a fill-race market,
handing a competitor your realised margin is directly adversarial (see
[ECONOMICS.md](./ECONOMICS.md) on the fill race) — it is a materially more
sensitive exposure than the relayer's operational metrics.

The endpoint therefore binds to `PERIHELION_METRICS_HOST=127.0.0.1` by default,
with a startup log warning if bound anywhere else. If you need to scrape it
from outside the host (a remote Prometheus, a shared monitoring VPC), set
`PERIHELION_METRICS_TOKEN` to a random secret and configure the scraper with
`Authorization: Bearer <token>` rather than widening the bind address alone.

## Troubleshooting

### Solver won't start

**Error: `Cannot find module 'dotenv'`**
```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

**Error: missing executor configuration**
- The solver is in `live` mode (the default) but one or more executor
  variables are unset. The error names them.
- Either set the full executor configuration (see
  [Executor configuration is mandatory in live mode](#executor-configuration-is-mandatory-in-live-mode)),
  or run with `PERIHELION_SOLVER_MODE=watch` to evaluate intents without
  filling them.

**Error: solver address does not match the EVM private key**
- `PERIHELION_SOLVER_ADDRESS` differs from the address derived from
  `PERIHELION_EVM_PRIVATE_KEY`. Unset `PERIHELION_SOLVER_ADDRESS` or set it to
  the derived address printed in the error.

**Error: `ECONNREFUSED` (mempool/RPC)**
- Verify `PERIHELION_MEMPOOL_URL`, `PERIHELION_EVM_RPC_URL`, `PERIHELION_SOROBAN_RPC_URL` are reachable
- Check firewall, proxy, or VPN settings
- Try pinging the endpoints:
  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:8080/status
  ```

### Intents not being filled

**Solver sees intents but rejects them**
1. Check `PERIHELION_MIN_MARGIN_BPS` — too high?
   - Lower to 10–15 bps if margins are thin
2. Check `priceDestAsset()` — returning valid quote?
   - Add debug logging to see quoted price vs. intent slippage
3. Check `PERIHELION_SUPPORTED_ASSETS` — intent asset included?
   - Ensure format matches: `native` or `CODE:ISSUER`

**Solver sees no intents**
1. Verify mempool is running and populated
   - Check `/intents` endpoint: `curl http://localhost:8080/intents`
2. Check `PERIHELION_SOLVER_ADDRESS` — is it reserved by any intents?
   - In `live` mode the address is derived from `PERIHELION_EVM_PRIVATE_KEY`;
     in `watch` mode it comes from `PERIHELION_SOLVER_ADDRESS`
   - If the address is not set or wrong, only open intents will be visible
3. Check deadline — intent must not be expired
   - Solver rejects intents with `deadline < now`

### Transactions fail on settlement

**"Insufficient fill amount"**
- Your quoted price dropped between quote and fill
- Check slippage tolerance; consider tighter pricing or pre-reserving liquidity

**"Intent not found" on Soroban**
- Intent was cancelled or expired before you called `fill_intent`
- Increase timeout or lower `PERIHELION_MIN_MARGIN_BPS` to compete faster

**"EVM transaction reverted"**
- Check escrow balance and allowances
- Verify EVM contract is not paused
- Check RPC is synced and not returning stale data

### High gas costs or slow fills

**EVM gas too expensive**
- Reduce frequency: increase `PERIHELION_POLL_INTERVAL_MS`
- Batch operations: consider multi-intent settlements (Phase 2)

**Slow fill times**
- Check RPC latency: time a simple `eth_blockNumber` call
- Consider a faster or local RPC endpoint
- Check Stellar ledger close times (normally ~5 seconds)

### Reputation not updating (Phase 3)

If you expect solver reputation tracking (Phase 3+):
- Ensure `dispatch_confirmation` is called after `deliver_intent`
- Wait for confirmation message to settle (LayerZero transport delay)

### Filled-but-undispatched: the split-entrypoint stall

**What it is.** `deliver_intent` and `dispatch_confirmation` are separate
entrypoints by design (Issue #12) — delivery is the atomic, irreversible step;
dispatch can be retried independently. The downside is that they can come apart:

1. The solver calls `deliver_intent`: the user receives the destination asset on
   Stellar, and the contract writes the `Settled` marker setting intent status
   to `Filled`.
2. The solver then fails to call `dispatch_confirmation` — out of XLM, a fee
   under-quote, a node crash, or a misconfiguration.
3. The intent sits in `Filled` state indefinitely. The source-chain escrow still
   holds the user's locked funds with `released == false`; it does not know the
   fill happened. `cancel_expired_intent` refuses to act because the `Settled`
   marker is present. No other solver can step in.
4. After `deadline + confirmationGrace`, the escrow's `cancelExpired` path
   returns the user's source funds — user receives both the destination asset on
   Stellar *and* a full refund — while the solver absorbs the entire loss.

**How to detect it.** The `status()` view distinguishes `Filled` (delivered,
undispatched) from `ConfirmationSent`. Use the `list_undispatched_intents`
contract view to batch-query your known intent hashes and filter for the ones
currently stuck in `Filled`:

```typescript
// Example using the Perihelion SDK / contract client
const allHashes = await mempool.getAllKnownHashes();
// Chunk to ≤50 hashes per call (instruction budget).
const chunks = chunk(allHashes, 50);
for (const batch of chunks) {
  const stuck = await settlementClient.list_undispatched_intents(batch);
  for (const hash of stuck) {
    logger.error({ hash }, "STUCK: intent filled but confirmation not dispatched");
    alerts.fire("dispatch_confirmation_stalled", { hash });
  }
}
```

Set up a cron or event-driven monitor that runs this query every few minutes
(or on every confirmed `filled` event). Alert on any intent that has been in
`Filled` state for more than 5 minutes; the clock is ticking toward `cancelExpired`
on the source chain.

**How to recover.** `dispatch_confirmation` is permissionless — any account can
call it, not just the original solver. That is the designed recovery path:

```typescript
// Any keeper (including your own solver) can push a stalled confirmation.
const lzFee = await settlementClient.quote_fill_confirmed_fee(srcEid);
// Add a small buffer for fee fluctuation (~10%).
await settlementClient.dispatch_confirmation(
  callerAddress,
  intentHash,
  BigInt(Math.ceil(Number(lzFee) * 1.1)),
);
```

**Keeper incentive.** The contract admin can configure `dispatch_keeper_reward`
(independently of `keeper_reward` for cancellations) via
`set_dispatch_keeper_reward`. When non-zero, a caller of `dispatch_confirmation`
other than the solver receives that many stroops from the contract's native
token balance, once the fill has been unconfirmed for about 30 minutes
(`DISPATCH_REWARD_GRACE_LEDGERS`, 360 ledgers). This compensates the LayerZero
fee for a stalled confirmation, making it economically rational for a
third-party keeper service to push it through. The solver's own dispatch never
earns the reward. See `docs/ECONOMICS.md` for the rationale.

Check the current reward and whether it covers your expected `lz_fee`:

```typescript
const reward = await settlementClient.dispatch_keeper_reward();
const fee    = await settlementClient.quote_fill_confirmed_fee(srcEid);
if (reward >= fee) {
  // Profitable for any keeper; rely on external keepers as backstop.
} else {
  // Self-serve only: your solver must ensure it remains funded.
  logger.warn("dispatch_keeper_reward does not cover lz_fee — no external incentive");
}
```

**Checklist for preventing this state:**
1. Always call `dispatch_confirmation` immediately after `deliver_intent` in
   your fill loop. Use `quote_fill_confirmed_fee` to size the fee; never pass
   0 when targeting mainnet.
2. Keep `PERIHELION_STELLAR_NATIVE_FEE_FLOOR` set to cover both `deliver_intent`
   *and* `dispatch_confirmation` (see [Native balance](#native-balance)).
   The worst position is running out of XLM between the two calls.
3. Monitor `list_undispatched_intents` on a short interval. Treat any alert as
   critical — you are racing the source chain's `cancelExpired` grace period.
4. Keep a funded fallback account that can call `dispatch_confirmation` as a
   keeper, independent of your main solver keypair.

## Performance Tips

1. **Pre-fetch quotes** — Batch asset pricing to reduce latency
2. **Keep liquidity warm** — Hold small reserves of supported assets to respond faster
3. **Optimize RPC** — Use high-uptime, low-latency endpoints (Alchemy, Infura, etc.)
4. **Monitor competition** — Track other solvers' fill rates and adjust your margin strategy
5. **Test locally first** — Always validate on testnet before mainnet
