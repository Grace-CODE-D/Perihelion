 *   source funds into escrow and dispatches the fill instruction to Stellar
 * - `cancelExpired()` to recover expired intents
 * - `confirmationGrace()` and `getLock()` (over the `locks` mapping getter)
 *   to verify intent status
 * - `isRefundable()` / `refundStatus()` to check, from chain state, whether

 *
 * This client provides type-safe helpers over viem's PublicClient and
